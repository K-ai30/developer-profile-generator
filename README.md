# Developer Profile Generator

### Description

Node.js and ES6+

The purpose of this application is to create a command-line application that generates a dynamic profile PDF populated with the following information:

- Profile image
- User name
- Links to the following:
    * User location via Google Maps
    * User GitHub profile
    * User blog
- User bio
- Number of public repositories
- Number of followers
- Number of GitHub stars
- Number of users following

Assuming the user has a profile, the data is collected from the user's GitHub profile as a result of a prompt asking for their username and favorite color.  The PDF file generated will then include their information in a color scheme matching their selection.

### Technologies Utilized:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Node.js
* Axios
* Inquirer
